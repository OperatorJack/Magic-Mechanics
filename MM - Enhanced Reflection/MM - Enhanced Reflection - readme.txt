Magic Mechanics - Enhanced Reflection
By: OperatorJack


===Requirements===
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not from January 12, 2020 or newer, you will receive errors.

===Description===
This mod adds reflection mechanics to the Reflect, Shield, Fire Shield, Shock Shield, and Frost Shield magic effects for both the Player and NPCs. The behaviour of these new mechanics can be controlled through the MCM.

Reflect: The Reflect magic effect will reflect spell projectiles directly back to their caster.
Shield: The Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles at a realistic angle, depending on where the projectile hits the shielded actor.
Fire Shield: The Fire Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the fire damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.
Shock Shield: The Shock Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the shock damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.
Frost Shield: The Frost Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the frost damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.

Reflection chance is based on the magnitude of the magic effect. Depending on the distance and angle of the projectile to the target, sometimes reflection will still fail (EG, casting from a few inches away).

Known Issues:
- If the projectile is reflected by to the caster, it will move through the caster. This is due to game engine limitations and cannot currently be resolved.
- The vanilla mechanic still applies, so you essentially get 2 mechanics per magic effect.

This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
